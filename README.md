# meswx.me

A static online Resume/CV template, support for English and Chinese.

I used the [`Vue`](https://cn.vuejs.org) to read from a json file for data binding, reducing the coupling between the template UI and the data. Users only need to care about the json data of their resumes to generate their own online resumes (styliszed, but customizable by users with a programming background).

Enjoy it 😘.

## Document

You can **fork** my warehouse, or **clone** it directly to the local via the following command:

```sh
$ git clone -b dev https://github.com/Meswx/meswx.me.git
```

Then, open `index.html` directly in your browser to see the effect.

**How do modify resume information？**

All you need to do is replace the information in bilingual json to generate your resume.

Simple~ 👨🏻‍💻 (thanks to Vue (https://cn.vuejs.org), the 🐂🍺 front-end framework must learn)

## Instructions

This template is not my original, the original author is **John Doe** (good job 👍), I downloaded from the website named [Templatewire](http://www.templatewire.com), then I added the code of vue to improve it, so I still want to thanks to the original author.
